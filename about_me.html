									<h4>Graduate Research Assistant, Azad Lab<br>
										University of North Texas</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									My name is David Burks, and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of North Texas.  I graduated with my B.S. in Biology in 2011 (also from North Texas), and currently study an important little family of nitrogen harvesting soil symbionts using a mixture of machine learning, network theory, and transcriptomic profiling.<br><br>
									The first year of my doctoral pursuit was spent, along with the brilliant minds of the Dickstein lab, studying a family of transcriptional factors and a unique nitrate transporter endogenous to barrelclover.  During this time, I gained an immense respect for the work involved in a wet-lab.  It was also here that I discovered my green thumb was more of a sickly yellow, that I should never be allowed near any plants that intend to live, and that I was much more dangerous with a keyboard than a pipette (unless you count the accidental chemhood fires).<br><br>
									I now spend the majority of my time writing code, collaborating with fellow researchers, and doing my part to advance science. Through my work with other labs, I have been given the opportunity to practice comparitive genomics, generate <i>de novo</i> assemblies, and apply various network inferences to help guide the efforts of other scientists.<br><br>
									I am an avid animal advocate, and spent several years working and volunteering in both clinical and shelter environments.  I'm helplessly bound to my two doofy cats, and an 11 year old dwarf rabbit that has been with me since my sophomore year of college.
									Thanks to a diverse cast of wonderful and patient people, I am well versed in the raising of orphaned animals (from kittens to opossums). When I'm not researching (and if my PI asks, the answer to that is "never"), you might find me completely absorbed in a good video game, reading something other than science journals, or working on my car.  Lately, I've been dinking around with my guitar, but my pets can only endure so many butchered attempts at Everlong before risking their lives chewing through the cable to make the bad sounds stop.
